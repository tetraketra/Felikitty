Hack-and-Slash card game deckbuilder based on cats


# Systems
Cards
 - Support deck and active skill deck. Support skills modify certain active skills on a tag system like PoE. Same sup can work on attack, aura, etc.
 - *Unlock System TBD*
 - *Progression TBD*
 
Combat
 - Hold `space` or start any combo to slow down the game. Release to activate.
 - Expend cards to activate a big hit, a continuous damage source, aura, buff, etc etc.
 
Bosses
 - Fancy intro cinematic with a false silhouette, but cuts to a catfish.

Aesthetic
 - Underwater? Good chance for cool combat systems.
 - Cat mermaids?
